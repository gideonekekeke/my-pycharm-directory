# this is a QUADRATIC EQUATION
# finding the root of an equation (x^2 - x - 6 )= 0
# using this method x = -b + or - square root of b^2 - 4ac to find the root
# first of all import maths

import math
a = 1
b = -1
c = -6
d = b**2 - 4*a*c;
d>0
solution1 =(-b + math.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
solution2 =(-b - math.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
print("the root of x^2 - x - 6  are",solution1,"and",solution2)
